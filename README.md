# DATA201-Group-project

There are two Jupyter Notebooks enclosed in our submission.
The main notebook - Group Project - contains the code that forms a dataset on fleet size, 
fuel use and carbon emissions, adjusted for population.
The second notebook - Fuel_price_inflation_calculations contains the code that joins inflation
rates, fuel prices and exchange rates to produce a dataset of the quarterly
tax rate, crude price and retail pump price, adjusted for inflation.

The notebooks are not connected in any programming sense - they can be run in either order. 
We decided to keep them separate since the dataset produced by each felt naturally
self contained.
